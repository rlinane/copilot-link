# copilot-link
I recently subscribed to github copilot to evaluate as a rapid application development tool.
I am going through some of the tutorials to understand how to leverage it is as tool and so far it is very easy to use.
There seem to be many benefits toward using this as a way to speed up delevery.

This is the first project I built while following through a demo of copilot.
comments in the code should identify how it was used.
